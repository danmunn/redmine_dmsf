Changelog for Redmine DMSF
==========================

1.6.2 *????-??-??*
------------------

1.6.1 *2018-04-03*
------------------
        
    Javascript on pages is loaded asynchronously
    Obsolete Dav4Rack gem replaced with an up to date fork by Planio (Consequently WebDAV caching has been removed, sorry...)        
        Cloned from gem https://github.com/planio-gmbh/dav4rack.git    
    Project members can be chosen as recipients when sending documents by email
    Responsive view (optimized for mobile devices)
    Direct editing of document in MS Office
    Korean & Dutch localisation
    Move folder feature
    Document versions can contain letters
    
IMPORTANT

1. `alias_method_chain` has been replaced with `prepend`. Not directly but using `RedmineExtensions::PatchManager`.

------------------

    Folder permissions    
    Documents attachable to issues
    Hungarian localization
    Full-text search in *.eml and *.msg

IMPORTANT

1. Files in the filesystem are re-organized by a new system based on dates. So, documents are not stored in folders named 
    by the project's identifier but by the data of uploading, e.g. 2017/09. It's the same system used by Redmine for 
    attachments.
2. DMS storage directory plugin option is related to the rails root directory.
3. The plugin is independent of the gem xapian-full-alaveteli which has been replaced with ruby-xapian package. Therefore
    is recommended to uninstall xapian-full-alaveteli gem and install ruby-xapian package in order the full-text search
    is working.

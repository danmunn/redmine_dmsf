    * MS Word documents (.doc, .dot) if antiword is available  
    * MS Excel documents (.xls, .xlb, .xlt) if xls2csv is available (comes with catdoc)  
    * MS Powerpoint documents (.ppt, .pps) if catppt is available (comes with catdoc)

    * Compressed AbiWord documents (.zabw) if gzip is available  
    * Rich Text Format documents (.rtf) if unrtf is available  
    * Perl POD documentation (.pl, .pm, .pod) if pod2text is available  
    * TeX DVI files (.dvi) if catdvi is available

```apt-get install libxapian-ruby1.9.1 xapian-omega libxapian-dev xpdf xpdf-utils antiword unzip\
 catdoc libwpd-0.9-9 libwps-0.2-2 gzip unrtf catdvi djview djview3 uuid uuid-dev```

On Ubuntu use:

```sudo apt-get install libxapian-ruby1.9.1 xapian-omega libxapian-dev xpdf antiword\
unzip catdoc libwpd-0.9-9 libwps-0.2-2 gzip unrtf catdvi djview djview3 uuid uuid-dev```

Usage
-----

DMSF is designed to act as project module, so it must be checked as an enabled module within the project settings.

Search will now automatically search DMSF content when a Redmine search is performed, additionally a "Documents" and "Folders" check box will be visible, allowing you to search DMSF content exclusively.

###Linking DMSF files from Wiki entries:

####Link to a file with id 17:
`{{dmsf(17)}}`

####Link to a file with id 17 with link text "File"
`{{dmsf(17, File)}}`

####Link to the description of a file with id 17
`{{dmsfd(17)}}`

The DMSF file/revision id can be found in link for file/revision download from within Redmine.

###Linking DMSF folders from Wiki entries:

####Link to a folder with id 5:
`{{dmsff(5)}}`

####Link to a folder with id 5 with link text "Folder"
`{{dmsff(5, Folder)}}`

The DMSF folder id can be found in the link when opening folders within Redmine.

You can also publish Wiki help description: 

In the file <redmine_root>/public/help/<language>/wiki_syntax_detailed.html, after the document link description/definition:

    <ul>
      <li>
        DMSF:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>{{dmsf(17)}}</strong> (a link to the file with id 17)</li>
          <li><strong>{{dmsf(17, File)}}</strong> (a link to the file with id 17 with the link text "File")</li>
          <li><strong>{{dmsf(17, File, 10)}}</strong> (a link to the file with id 17 with the link text "File" and the link pointing to the revision 10)</li>
          <li><strong>{{dmsfd(17)}}</strong> (a link to the description of the file with id 17)</li>
          <li><strong>{{dmsff(5)}}</strong> (a link to the folder with id 5)</li>
          <li><strong>{{dmsff(5, Folder)}}</strong> (a link to the folder with id 5 with the link text "Folder")</li>
        </ul>
        The DMSF file/revision id can be found in the link for file/revision download from within Redmine.<br />
        The DMSF folder id can be found in the link when opening folders within Redmine.
      </li>
    </ul>

In the file <redmine_root>/public/help/<language>/wiki_syntax.html, at the end of the Redmine links section:

    <tr><th></th><td>{{dmsf(83)}}</td><td>Document <a href="#">#83</a></td></tr>

There's a patch that helps you to modify all help files at once. In your Redmine folder:

`cd public/help`

`patch -p0 < plugins/redmine_dmsf/extra/help_files_dmsf.diff`


Setup / Upgrade
---------------

Before installing ensure that the Redmine instance is stopped.

1. In case of upgrade BACKUP YOUR DATABASE first
2. Put redmine_dmsf plugin directory into plugins
3. Initialize/Update database: `bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV="production"`
4. The access rights must be set for web server, example: `chown -R www-data:www-data plugins/redmine_dmsf`
5. Restart web server
6. You should configure plugin via Redmine interface: Administration -> Plugins -> DMSF -> Configure
7. Assign DMSF permissions to appropriate roles
8. There are two rake tasks:

    a) To convert documents from the standard Redmine document module

        Available options:

            * project  => id or identifier of project (defaults to all projects)
            * dry  => true or false (default false) to perform just check without any conversion
            * invalid=replace  => to perform document title invalid characters replacement for '-'

        Example:
            
            rake redmine:dmsf_convert_documents project=test RAILS_ENV="production"

    b) To alert all users who are expected to do an approval in the current approval steps

        Example:
            
            rake redmine:dmsf_alert_approvals RAILS_ENV="production"            

### Fulltext search (optional)
If you want to use fulltext search features, you must setup file content indexing.

It is necessary to index DMSF files with omega before searching attempts to receive some output:

  1. Change the configuration part of redmine_dmsf/extra/xapian_indexer.rb file according to your environment.
  2. Run `ruby redmine_dmsf/extra/xapian_indexer.rb -f`

This command must be run on regular basis (e.g. from cron)

Example of cron job (once per hour at 8th minute):
    
    8 * * * * root /usr/bin/ruby redmine_dmsf/extra/xapian_indexer.rb -f

See redmine_dmsf/extra/xapian_indexer.rb for help.

Uninstalling DMSF
-----------------
Before uninstalling the DMSF plugin, please ensure that the Redmine instance is stopped.

1. `cd [redmine-install-dir]`
2. `rake redmine:plugins:migrate NAME=redmine_dmsf VERSION=0 RAILS_ENV=production`
3. `rm plugins/redmine_dmsf -Rf`

After these steps re-start your instance of Redmine.
